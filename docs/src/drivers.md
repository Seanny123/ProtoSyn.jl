# Drivers

Drivers are a set set of functions that drive the simulation to new states, often exploring the conformational space of the system in Monte Carlo algorithms (with the combination of [Mutators](@ref Mutators) with acceptance/rejection rules) or the application of minimizers (such as the Steppest Descent Algorithm).

## Monte Carlo

```@meta
CurrentModule = Drivers.MonteCarlo
```

This section provides a description on the Monte Carlo Driver. This Driver iterates over a set amount of `n_steps` (defined in the [`MonteCarlo.Driver`](@ref)), sampling new conformations to the [`Common.State`](@ref) and accepting or rejecting them based on the Metropolis Algorithm.

## Steepest Descent

```@meta
CurrentModule = Drivers.SteepestDescent
```

This section provides a description on the Steepest Descent Driver. This Driver attempts to minimize the system energy based on the provided [`Topology`](@ref Forcefield), as it calculates the forces acting on each atom according to the defined [`SteepestDescent.Driver`](@ref). The finalization criteria is:
- Maximum number of steps was achieved (SteepestDescentDriver.n_steps).
- Maximum force calculated is below the force tolerance (SteepestDescentDriver.f_tol).
- The gamma (Î³) applied in the next step of the Steepest Descent is below machine precision.

## ILSRR

```@meta
CurrentModule = Drivers.ILSRR
```

This section provides a description on the ILSRR Driver. This Driver employs the Iterated Local Search with Random Restarts algorithm. In this algorithm, an inner driver
creates and evaluates new conformations, saving the best structure in energetic terms. This search can be, for example, a Temperature Annealing, Monte Carlo, etc
The best structure is then evaluated according to a outer temperature, being saved as a new homebase depending on the Metropolis criteria. The current homebase serves as
the starting point for a perturbation, where the structure in highly mutated in order to restart the inner cycle in another point of the conformational space.
